## What is this?

A simple prompt builder for AI music generators like Suno, Udio, etc.

## How it works

Pick your genre, mood, and energy curve. The tool auto-fills a song structure with instruments and arrangement notes for each section. Tweak whatever you want or just trust the defaults. Hit generate, copy the prompt, paste it into your AI music tool.

No backend, no AI, no accounts. Just a single HTML page.
