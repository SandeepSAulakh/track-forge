# TrackForge 🎹

A simple prompt builder for AI music generators like Suno, Udio, etc.

## What is this?

Most people just type "make me a sad rock song" into Suno and get a boring 2-minute loop. This tool helps you build a proper structured prompt — with song sections, instruments, energy flow, and all that — so the output actually sounds like a real song.

## How it works

Pick your genre, mood, and energy curve. The tool auto-fills a song structure with instruments and arrangement notes for each section. Tweak whatever you want or just trust the defaults. Hit generate, copy the prompt, paste it into your AI music tool.

No backend, no AI, no accounts. Just a single HTML page.
